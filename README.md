- 👋 Hi, I’m @Glassmade
- 👀 I’m interested in anything about coding!
- 🌱 I’m currently returned to being a developer working in a Java/React Stack!
- Under the compilation of these repos you'll find personal projects and other experimental learning pockets!
- Most of my repositories are private, just send me a message if anyhting interests you! :D
- 💞️ After learning a few new tricks as a Performance Engineer, I am back into developing and buzzin about it~
- 📫 How to reach me you can comment on my code for starters! :D
