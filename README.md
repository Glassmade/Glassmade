- 👋 Hi, I’m @DKoulialis
- 👀 I’m interested in anything about coding!
- 🌱 I’m currently working in Medicine technologies with CorEvitas.
- Under the compilation of these repositories you'll find personal projects and other experimental learning pockets!
- Most of my repositories are private, but if you know anything of what I am doing send me a direct message to provide you with access.
- 💞️ This is my 5th year as an IT professional and I keep loving it! :D
- 📫 If you do not know how to reach me, just leave a comment in one of my code lines. I'll appreciate your thoughts regardless! :)
