- 👋 Hi, I’m @Glassmade
- 👀 I’m interested in anything about coding, especially if it is game and bot scripting (easier to pick up I suppose)
- 🌱 I’m currently working with new tools, Kibana, ElasticSearch, Dynatrace and Grafana!
- However, I am still keep relevant to Java with my grind project!
- This is a project I am running on my free time to keep my Java hands relevant and my develop skills fresh.
- I usually make it public when I am looking for a job, but you are free to ask for viewing access! :D
- 💞️ I’m enjoying my new Perfomance Engineering gig @ Sky, and my side projects here! :D
- 📫 How to reach me you can comment on my code for starters! :D
