- 👋 Hi, I’m @Glassmade
- 👀 I’m interested in anything about coding, especially if it is game and bot scripting (easier to pick up I suppose)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Selenium, Cucumber (hopefully I will update this part soon!)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Performance Engineering in my new Role @ Sky!
- 📫 How to reach me you can comment on my code for starters! :D
